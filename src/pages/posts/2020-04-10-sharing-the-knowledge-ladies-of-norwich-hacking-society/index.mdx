Who doesn’t recognise the dark hooded figure in a badly lit room, with the light of the blue screen on their face, tapping out their nefarious plans on the keyboard? With the media, movies and even a slew of documentaries on Netflix now dedicated to the murky world of the dark web and crime on the internet, we all know that character. But that is exactly what it is, a caricature of a person with a set of technical skills, no more.

## The reality

There is not much time and screen space dedicated to the actual hardworking techies who protect computers, networks, websites and humans on a day to day basis. Even fewer hours dedicated to the women who complete these jobs.

When I first became interested in the area of information security, I wanted to learn. I went looking for help to get started and I found a few people within the county (Norfolk) who have spent many years working in security.

> They are excited by their subject, are very generous with their time and their advice and are highly technical. They are rare, and they are all men. This in itself is no issue, but I was left wondering, “Where are all the women?”.

## Setting up

In Norfolk there is such a vibrant tech meetup space with so many different subjects covered, so it seemed like a good plan to build a meetup and see if we couldn’t get some women all in the same room to talk about these things. If you want to build something new, it’s best to learn from those who have smashed it before you, so I went to London to meet Eliza May Austin, the founder of the not-for-profit organisation the Ladies of London Hacking Society (LLHS). Eliza was passionate about sharing knowledge between women in a technical, male-dominated environment, she had created the hacking society with motivations and ideals similar to my own, and she suggested the creation of the first chapter of the hacking society outside of London, The Ladies of Norwich Hacking Society (LNHS).

## Combatting hacking

LNHS is a woman centric not exclusive meetup that offers an open and supportive learning and networking space. No question is a stupid one, if you don’t know the answer, no doubt someone else will and can help. The meetup is open to all, but the values have to be adhered to. No heated competition, no trying to outsmart each other, just support and willingness to both learn and teach.

The hacking society events are supported by the cyber industry, but one of the largest contributions is from Immersive Labs, who supply a fantastic platform for LNHS members to use, free of charge. They offer online training using virtual Linux and Windows boxes that allow the practice of offensive and defensive cyber skills in a safe environment. Labs completed since our inception have included using the Social Engineering Toolkit to build a malicious pdf document, active network reconnaissance using tools such as Nmap, and inspecting web traffic packets using Wireshark in order to break into a web app. Coming up in the near future will be sessions on SQL injection, credential cracking and reverse engineering malware. One of the best elements to the labs is the encouragement of curiosity. Many of them use a ‘capture the flag’ approach and instead of spoon-feeding learning allow you the opportunity to explore and research online in the search for those answers.

## Meet the LNHS

On top of the labs, meetups include a guest speaker from industry or academia to share their knowledge. Topics range from every day, front line security and advice, to new and upcoming research. Previous support from guest speakers has included SureCloud, UEA, and a particularly lively session with the Norfolk & Suffolk Police's Joint Cyber Crime Unit who ran an interactive cyber incident exercise… with Lego! There is pizza, something tasty to drink and every meetup is completely free of charge.

Whether you are a software developer who thinks some security knowledge would make a great addition to your skill set, or you are a Linux whizz and want to share some of that super knowledge, you are just curious or perhaps already a CISO, LNHS would love to have you. All events are on our meetup page: <https://www.meetup.com/LNHS-Ladies-Of-Norwich-Hacking-Society/> so please come and join us, bring a laptop, get stuck in and learn. No previous technical knowledge required, all sessions are accessible to all levels.
