excerpt: I always found Twitter less of a burden than other networks, with higher signal to noise.
---

Lately I've stopped tweeting. This in itself isn't significant. What causes pause for thought is the fact that using Twitter between 2007 and 2013 connected me to opportunities which helped me to travel the world, and set the trajectory for my career working on startups. Life defining things.

I always found Twitter less of a burden than other networks, with higher signal to noise. Of course brevity helps in that regard. There are always links for when you need details. Twitter was useful, and allowed me to communicate without the pressure of the empty page.

Over time I followed too many busy accounts and my feed became overwhelming. I attempted to counter this with lists and software but failed.

It feels like time to reevaluate and figure out how to fix this. We had some good times.

Hopefully I can find some enjoyment there again. Some connections. Some novelty.
